# Coding Standards

## Core Principles

### Minimalism (Occam's Razor)
If two approaches work and meet our standards, choose the smaller one. Apply this to code length, dependency count, and conceptual complexity.

### Self-Documenting Code
Code must speak for itself. Comments are a code smell indicating something needs fixing later. Only comment when explaining truly confusing behavior that can't be immediately refactored.

Replace `comment_philosophy: "Explain why, not what"` with: eliminate comments by making code clearer.

### Honesty Everywhere
Never allow mock interfaces or test data without clear self-identification. No silent deception in codebases.
This goes for fallback mechanisms too: fallback and graceful degredation should never be silent.

### Vertical Alignment
Align related code vertically to show relationships. Use REPL to generate columnar content when manual alignment is difficult.

## Alignment Examples

From the CoffeeScript example:

```coffee
express    = require 'express'
cors       = require 'cors'

routing    = require './lib/routing'
middleware = require './lib/middleware'
config     = require './lib/config'


URL_PREFIX = "https://#{config.VAULT_SERVER}"


module.exports.app =
  app = express()

middleware.setup(app)
routing   .setup(app)
```

### Alignment Rules

- **Related imports**:       Line up assignment operators
- **Blank lines**:           Separate conceptual sections (imports vs config vs initialization)
- **Method calls**:          Line up dots when calling similar methods (`.setup(app)`)
- **Export pattern**:        `module.exports.foo = foo =` instead of single assignment at end
- **Indentation hierarchy**: Indent continuation lines to show relationship
- **Semantic grouping**:     Don't align unrelated operations even if they look similar
- **Language constraints**:  Respect syntax requirements (Python whitespace) over alignment

### Multi-Column Alignment: The Three-Column Pattern

When data has structure with left context, significant middle, and right context, align in three columns:

```coffee
MODERN_FEATURES = [
  /// \b const         \s+ ///
  /// \b let           \s+ ///
  /// \b class         \s+ ///
  /// \b async         \s+ ///
  /// \b await         \s+ ///
  /// \b import        \s+ ///
  /// \b export        \s+ ///

  ///    BigInt            ///
  ///    \d+ n          \b ///

  ///    for \s* await     ///
  ///    ` [^`]* `         ///

  ///    =>                ///
  ///    \?\?              ///
  ///    \? \. (?!\d)      ///
  ///    \*\*              ///
  ///    \*\*=             ///
  ///    \.\.\.            ///
]
```

**What this reveals:**
- **Left column** (`\b`): Start-of-word anchors
- **Middle column**: The actual pattern being matched (keywords, operators, literals)
- **Right column** (`\s+`, `\b`): End-of-word/whitespace requirements
- **Blank lines**: Semantic grouping (keywords, BigInts, special syntax, operators)

**Benefits:**
- Scan vertically to see all keywords/operators/patterns
- Spot mistakes easily (misalignments stand out)
- See patterns emerge (groupings become obvious)
- Add similar items without disrupting visual structure

**This is why we avoid comments.** The code structure itself communicates the organization.

### Non-Alignment Indicators

- Different conceptual categories (imports vs assignments vs exports)
- Unrelated operations that happen to have similar structure
- Syntax conflicts in whitespace-sensitive languages

## Output Formatting

Columnar data in output strings should align:

```coffee
console.log """
  Port:            #{config.PORT}
  Environment:     #{config.NODE_ENV or 'development'}
  Repository Path: #{config.REPO_PATH}
  Vault Server:    #{config.VAULT_SERVER}
"""
```

Use variables to reduce redundancy:
```coffee
  URL_PREFIX = "https://#{config.VAULT_SERVER}"
  # Then use URL_PREFIX in output strings
```

## Patterns

### Define functions after their first use

```coffee
main ->
  options   = getOptions ()
  ourWorld  =
    options :            options
    display : getDisplay options
    rules   : getRules   options
  
  runGame        ourWorld

  exitGracefully ourWorld

getOptions   = ->
  Object.assign {}, defaultOptions(), overridenOptions()

defaultOptions = ->
  user:
    name:       "player1"
  rules:
    module:     "basic"
    difficulty: "for babies"

overridenOptions = ->
  # look in the usual locations for config files and return their contents

getDisplay   = (options) ->
  # start SDL or WebGL or whatever

getRules     = (options) ->
  # require() some modules referenced in the options

runGame      = (ourWorld) ->
  # event loop

gracefulExit = (ourWorld) ->
  # return resources, close handles, etc
```

### Abstract out repetition into data structures

Express if/else if/else chains as arrays of functions to invoke.

```coffee

objectMap = (o, fn) ->
  Object.keys o
        .map fn

objectInvokeValues = (o) ->
  Object.fromEntries objectMap (k) -> [k, o[k]()]

# Define detectors as a data structure

CAPABILITY_DETECTORS =
  featureName : -> detection logic here
  anotherOne  : -> more detection logic
  
  # Group related detectors visually
  grouped1    : -> similar detection pattern
  grouped2    : -> similar detection pattern
  
  # Separate different patterns with blank lines
  different   : -> different kind of detection

detectCapabilities = -> objectInvokeValues CAPABILITY_DETECTORS

# Later...
capabilities = detectCapabilities()
```

Benefits:

* Extensible: Add/remove capabilities by editing data, not code
* Testable: Can mock detectors for testing
* Readable: Left column shows what, right column shows how
* Composable: Can merge detector sets, filter them, etc.
